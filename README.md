Yuki's Web Interface for [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/)

A very ultra-basic web interface to see Kodi's database through a web browser

## Why another web interface for Kodi?
The main reason is that the default web interface [Chorus](https://github.com/xbmc/chorus2) cannot stream properly on iPads.

This web interface will let you navigate through your Kodi's library, select a movie and open it in your iOS device via [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-ios.html)


## Features
- [x] View your Kodi's library (Movies And TV-Shows)
- [ ] View your Files
- [ ] View a movie in your iOS device through VLC
- [ ] Control Kodi with the built-in remote
